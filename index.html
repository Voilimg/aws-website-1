            <p>At first I created a Repository on my GitHub account, its name: 
            aws-website, then I create a file name is index.html.After that I login 
            my AWS account and scroll down click the Host a static web app link and 
            choose github and click the Next button. Choose the second link which 
            Add a custom domain with a free SSL certificate. Then I click the Route 
            53 and try to apply my domain name. I applied my domain name some days
            before on AWS then I have my first host website. So now just click here
