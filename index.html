        <h2>How did I host a static website from GitHub to AWS Amplify?</h2>
        <p>Hello everyone, I am Ling , I started to learn coding by myself 
         since last year, I learned HTML CSS and some JavaScript, and now I 
         want to host my website from GitHub to AWS Amplify, <strong>What is AWS 
         Amplify?</strong></p>
        <p>AWS Amplify is a set of purpose-built tools and features that lets 
         frontend web and mobile developers quickly and easily build full-stack 
         applications on AWS with the flexibility to leverage the breadth of AWS 
         services as your use cases evolve. With Amplify, you can configure a web 
         or mobile app backend. connect your app in minutes, visually build a web 
         frontend UI, and easily manage app content outside the AWS console. Ship 
         faster and scale effortlessly-- with no cloud expertise needed</p>
        <p>At first I created a Repository on my GitHub account, its name: 
         aws-website, then I create a file name is index.html.After that I login 
         my AWS account and scroll down click the Host a static web app link and 
         choose github and click the Next button. Choose the second link which 
         Add a custom domain with a free SSL certificate. Then I click the Route 
         53 and try to apply my domain name. I applied my domain name some days
         before on AWS then I have my first host website. So now just click here
         https://violingdesign.com/ you can go on my webside. I am still working 
         on it. </p>
